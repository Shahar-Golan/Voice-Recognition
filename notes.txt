1. convert to mono to reduce noise (side noise that aint speaking)
2. Resample to 16 kHz - Whisper works well with 16kHz
3. Wav - uncompressed format of the file.

Take MP3 → Make it one clean channel → Make it the correct quality → Save it as a clean WAV for analysis

The process to make it ASR took 20 min aprrox for a 3 hour file.

You run:
ASR → transcription
Diarization → speaker timestamps
Then you merge the two.

chopping the audio into short windows (e.g., ~2–5 seconds).
passing them through a neural network to detect speech / generate speaker embeddings.
clustering those embeddings into speakers (S0, S1, …).
merging adjacent regions from the same speaker.

Joe Rogan: 1095 segments

Total number of ASR segments: 4780

Goal: For each segment WAV file, compute prosodic features, including:
      1) pitch variability
      2) amplitude dynamics
      3) formant dispersion
      4) pitch change rate

1. Pitch variability - describes how much the pitch (fundamental frequency, F0) fluctuates inside a segment.
    F0 = a vector (sequence) of pitch values across the whole segment (K frames in a segment)
    F0 = how fast the vocal folds vibrate
    pitch_variability=std(F0)

2. Amplitude Dynamics -capture how much the loudness (energy) changes within a segment
    RMS = how strong the sound wave is. Shouting: high RMS
    Energy variability = std(RMS)

3. Formant Dispersion - describes the spacing between formants.
    about how far apart the formants are from each other.


4. Pitch change rate - measures how fast pitch moves from one frame to the next.
    captures dynamism and instability in pitch.
    High pitch change rate → nervousness, agitation, emphasis, emotional activation
    Low rate → controlled and stable speaking
