1. convert to mono to reduce noise (side noise that aint speaking)
2. Resample to 16 kHz - Whisper works well with 16kHz
3. Wav - uncompressed format of the file.

Take MP3 → Make it one clean channel → Make it the correct quality → Save it as a clean WAV for analysis

The process to make it ASR took 20 min aprrox for a 3 hour file.

You run:
ASR → transcription
Diarization → speaker timestamps
Then you merge the two.

chopping the audio into short windows (e.g., ~2–5 seconds).
passing them through a neural network to detect speech / generate speaker embeddings.
clustering those embeddings into speakers (S0, S1, …).
merging adjacent regions from the same speaker.
